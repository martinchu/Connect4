# Connect 4 Artifical Intelligence(Text Version)

This program is modelled after Connect 4, a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.

- The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.

- The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of oneâ€™s own discs.

The Target of the Aritifical Intelligence is win at least 60%. The Aritifical Intelligence is applying the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and alpha-beta pruning in order to stop the potential losses and exploit potential victories.

The AI has to simulate the future states by creating a tree of all possible scenarios. The height of the tree will depend on how many steps AI will be looking ahead. If the AI is going to 2 steps ahead (provided the opponent will not win in the next move regardless), it is going to generate 7^2 = 49 future states.

To take computational cost and time complexity into account, the default IQ parameter for the AI is 6. i.e. AI will be looking 6 steps ahead when it decides to make a move. A set of heurisitic functions are put in place to make sure AI is evaluating the states accurately.

Some decisions are made in order to speed up the runtime of AI. For example, AI is always dropping the first checker to the middle column. Research has supported that it is the best move.

Again, IQ of AI is set to 3 in order to keep the AI fast without always losing. It can be changed in the source code as it is one of the parameters of the AI contructor when it is called.

The project is a original project. No codes have been copied. The project has taken inspirations by the list of sources on the reference list and previous projects that I have worked on. All the codes (excludes the libraries) are coded by myself.

## Installation

1. Clone or Download the reposity. If you clone the reposity via command line, please disregard step 2.

2. Extract the zip file

3. Open Terminal

4. type
```
   cd Path/to/Connect4/Directory/
```

5. Type
```
   make
```

6. Type
```
   ./c4
```
   and start the game!

### Installation Troubleshoot
If the X11/Xlib.h is not found during step 5, type
```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
```
and the error should be resolved.


## Structure

C++ is chosen due to its well-rounded implementation of object-oriented programming.

The following objects are created:
- __Grid__: Contains 7x6 cells and helper functions & fields that helpe AI decide its decision-making process. It will also check if one of the players won the game
- __Cell__: Each Cell will notify the display object (Grpahical or Text)
- __Node__: a Tree Structure that contains a Board for the AI to evaluate future states
- __Player__: a Pure Virtual Class that adds/drops checkers to the board, i.e. play the game
  -__AI__: Aritifical Intelligence that analyzes the current Board and drops the checker to the right columns
  -__Human__: Human Player for both mode
- __TextDisplay__: Responsible for outputting the Board to the Command Line
- __Window__: GUI (not implemented yet, pending further versions)

The project is well-structured. All the items have applied a lot of OOP theories (Abstraction, Polymorphism).

However, the current drawbacks are:

1. It does not live on the web at the moment.
2. Windows (Vista/7/8) users might have a tough time to boot the game up.
3. GUI is not integrated yet.
